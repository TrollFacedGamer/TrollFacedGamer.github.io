                <p class="projectText">
                    Lost Cat 2 is a text based adventure game about a lost cat waking in a desolate alleyways and exploring the surroundings. 
                    It is based on my other text based adventure game, Lost Cat, which is just a less functional and older version of Lost Cat 2. 
                    This game series was originally created for a school project and went through an overhaul to allow for loops despite the lack of actual loop commands which are substituted by function commands to improve game play. 
                    It is written in Python, uses ascii text for decoration and uses the console to interact with players. 
                    On a personal note the most challenging part of this project was the combat scene as I have to use only function commands to get the scene to loop while retaining combat information.

                <p class="projectText">
                    Streamline News is a start-up based around the idea of myth-busting and charity. 
                    The idea was made with my group of 4 for a project at Brooklyn Steam Center where we made a website based on a start-up we came up with. 
                    This project is important as it was the first time we employed Bootstrap for the CSS. 
                    The project was one of my most hectic projects as it was the first time we used branches to code as a team, 
                    which resulted in some problems as parts of the code that were supposed to be shared with all of our sections in unavailable when we began coding our part forcing us to hasty plug the holes in the program.

                <h3>Miner Robot Clicker</h3>

                <a href="https://trollfacedgamer.github.io/Miner-Robot-Clicker/" target="_blank" class="projectLink"><img src="images/sprites/robot icon.jpg" alt="" class="projectImg"></a>
                <p class="projectText">
                    Miner Robot Clicker is a clicker themed around mining and robots or machines in general. 
                    It is made in HTML, JS, and CSS, and uses Howler. 
                    It uses sounds and images from the internet from sites such as https://opengameart.org/ and https://www.freepik.com. 
                    It was made for a school project for Brooklyn Steam Center and was the first time I incorporated sounds into my works, 
                    this caused the most challenging part of this project to be the sound effect incorporation and the creation of the muting. 
                    The second most difficult part however is the log system as I had a hard time figuring out how to translate the upgrades into logs correctly. 
                    However, it was still the image finding for the game that ate up the most time as I am often discontent with the image I found or blocked by a paywall.

                <h3>Kelptopia 1</h3>
                <a href="https://github.com/TrollFacedGamer/Kelptopia-1" target="_blank" class="projectLink"><img src="images/sprites/seaweed.png" alt="" class="projectImg"></a>
                <p class="projectText">
                    Kelptopia 1 is a text-based adventure game that is made in HTML, JS, and CSS. 
                    It uses buttons and paragraphs with display text and options. 
                    In fact, more than half of the js code is for creating new buttons and editing their properties so players can use them to move from one scene to the next. 
                    Another chuck of the JS code is used to edit the text for storytelling, so only a very small part is used for calculations. 
                    Kelptopia 1 was made during the summer using a random idea I made with my cousin. 
                    However, the primary purpose was still to be a platform for me to practice over the summer of 2024 so I don't get rusty. 
                    Story-wise the game is about a dystopian society centered around kelp as food and fuel. 
                    The inspiration came from news about kelp farming and how in Minecraft kelp block is great for fuel while dried kelp itself is eatable.
